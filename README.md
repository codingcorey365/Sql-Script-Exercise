# Sql-Script-Exercise
This GitHub repository contains a collection of SQL scripts designed for querying product and employee databases. These scripts are practical for retail managers and database administrators who need to extract specific information from large datasets efficiently. Below are the highlights of the functionalities provided by the SQL scripts in this project:

1. Basic Product Queries:
   - Retrieve all entries from the products table.
   - Filter products by exact price points such as $1400, $11.99, and $13.99.
   - Utilize logical operators to exclude products priced at $11.99.

2. Sorting and Distinct Selections:
   - Sort products by price in descending order to identify the most expensive items readily.
   - Query distinct product prices to understand the pricing structure without duplication.

3. Employee Specific Queries:
   - Identify employees lacking a middle initial, potentially aiding in data cleanup or HR processes.
   - Filter employees whose names start with the letter 'J', useful for targeted communications or record management.

4. Product Availability and Sales Analysis:
   - Extract details of products currently on sale.
   - Determine the average price of products to gauge overall inventory value.
   - Select products within a specific stock level range, sorted by price for inventory review.

5. Advanced Filtering:
   - Locate specific product models like 'Macbook' using pattern matching.
   - Target specific employee roles such as 'Geek Squad' members lacking middle initials for specialized tasks or audits.

This repository ensures SQL queries are not only ready to be executed but also meticulously documented to support ease of use and customization. Perfect for businesses looking to refine their data-driven decision-making processes or individuals seeking to enhance their SQL querying skills.
